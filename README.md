# Android Tech Challenge

## Overview

You have been asked to create an Android app to manage tasks. Someone has already worked on it, but it is on vacation now, so you must resume the work. Currently, the app has a single screen showing a list of tasks stored in a local database. The UI was built using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/compose) and the database was implemented using [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room).

## Before the interview

- Make sure you have the latest version of [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).
- Clone the repository and run the app. You should be able to share the app running on a physical device or an Android emulator.
